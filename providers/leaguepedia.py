Leaguepedia (lol.fandom.com) Cargo API client.

Leaguepedia receives official esports match data from Riot's data disclosure
program and maintains a public MediaWiki/Cargo database.

Two tables are used:
  - ScoreboardGames: game-level data (winner, patch, duration, team names)
  - ScoreboardPlayers: per-player stats (champion, KDA, items, runes, gold)

This approach bypasses Riot Match-V5 entirely:
  Competitive games are on Riot's internal tournament servers and are NOT
  accessible via the public Match-V5 API. Leaguepedia is the canonical
  source for this data.

Rate limit: anonymous access is approximately 1 request per 8-9 seconds.
All callers must sleep RATE_LIMIT_SECONDS between sequential requests.
