## Features

- **FastAPI REST API** — serve professional match data via HTTP endpoints
- **Two-phase live pipeline** — sync (LoL Esports) + background enrichment (Leaguepedia)
- **Full player stats** — champion, KDA, gold, CS, items (names), runes (names), summoner spells
- **Leaguepedia integration** — only public source for competitive game data (Riot Match-V5 does not expose tournament server games)
- **Enrichment daemon** — background job processes pending games every 30 minutes, respects rate limits
- **Deduplication** — `riot_enriched` flag prevents re-processing; `enrichment_attempts` counter abandons after 3 failures
- **Historical backfill** — imports ALL editions of a league from Leaguepedia (CBLOL since 2013, resumable)
- **Oracle's Elixir ingest** — bulk-indexes OE CSV exports (97K+ games, all major leagues); idempotent (`op_type=create`)
- **Oracle's Elixir backfill** — fills missing stats (damage_taken, wards) on Leaguepedia docs using OE CSV as join source
- **Multi-league** — CBLOL, CBLOL Academy, Circuito Desafiante, LCS, LEC, LCK, LPL, and more
- **Production ready** — Docker Compose with Traefik/SSL for Coolify deployment

## Architecture

The system has four independent pipelines that all write to the same ES index (`lol_pro_matches`):

```
Phase 1 — Live Sync (scraper-cron, every 1h)
  LoL Esports API
    └─ getCompletedEvents → series with games + YouTube VOD IDs
         └─ competitive_pipeline.py
              └─ bulk_index → ES (riot_enriched: false)

Phase 2 — Enrichment (enrichment-daemon, every 30min)
  query_unenriched(ES) → pending games
    └─ For each game (2 Leaguepedia requests + 9s sleep each):
         1. ScoreboardGames  → page_name, winner, patch, gamelength
         2. ScoreboardPlayers → 10 players with champion/KDA/items/runes
         └─ update_document(ES, riot_enriched: true, participants: [...])

Phase 3 — Historical Backfill (one-off / daily cron via Rails Sidekiq)
  Leaguepedia Tournaments table → all OverviewPages for a league
    └─ historical_backfill.py (resumable — persists progress to JSON)
         └─ For each tournament not yet completed:
              └─ leaguepedia_pipeline.py → bulk_index → ES

Phase 4 — Oracle's Elixir Ingest (one-off / manual re-run)
  OE CSV files (annual download, 97K+ games, all major leagues)
    └─ oracles_elixir_ingest.py
         └─ op_type='create' → ES (idempotent, skips duplicates)
         └─ oracles_elixir_backfill.py → fills damage_taken/wards on existing docs
```

Why Leaguepedia instead of Riot Match-V5: competitive games run on Riot's internal
tournament servers and **do not appear in the public Match-V5 API**. Leaguepedia
receives official data from Riot's esports disclosure program and is the only
public source for these stats.

Why Oracle's Elixir: broader league coverage and additional stat columns
(damage_taken, wards_placed, wards_killed) not always available via Leaguepedia.
OE CSVs are a login-gated annual download — re-run ingest when a new year's CSV is available.

## API Endpoints

### Public

```bash
GET /health                        # Health check (Elasticsearch connectivity)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: add RIOT_API_KEY, ESPORTS_API_KEY, SCRAPER_API_KEY

# 2. Start services (Elasticsearch + API + enrichment daemon)
docker compose up -d

# 3. Verify health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 4. Sync CBLOL matches
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sync?league=CBLOL&limit=20" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key"

# 5. Check enrichment progress (daemon runs automatically every 30min)
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/enrich/status" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key"

# 6. Query enriched matches
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/matches?league=CBLOL&limit=5"
```

---

## Production Deployment

**Deploy to Coolify**: see [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for full guide.

### Summary

1. Create Docker Compose application in Coolify
2. Point to repository with `docker-compose.production.yml`
3. Configure environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables))
4. Set domain: `scraper.prostaff.gg`
5. Deploy and verify: `curl https://scraper.prostaff.gg/health`

### First deploy — index creation

The `lol_pro_matches` Elasticsearch index is created automatically on first sync.
If deploying over an existing installation with the old schema (pre-Leaguepedia),
delete the index first so it is recreated with the updated mapping:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://your-elasticsearch-host:9200/lol_pro_matches
```

## Environment Variables

See `.env.example` for the full template.

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ESPORTS_API_KEY` | LoL Esports Persisted Gateway key (for sync) |
| `RIOT_API_KEY` | Riot Games API key (for sync, not needed for enrichment) |
| `SCRAPER_API_KEY` | Secret key to protect write endpoints (sync, enrich) |

### Optional

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` | `http://elasticsearch:9200` | ES connection URL |
| `DEFAULT_PLATFORM_REGION` | `BR1` | Default Riot platform region |
| `API_PORT` | `8000` | FastAPI server port |
| `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://api.prostaff.gg,...` | Comma-separated allowed origins |

### Scraper cron settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SYNC_LEAGUES` | `CBLOL` | Space-separated leagues to sync |
| `SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `1` | Sync interval in hours |
| `SYNC_LIMIT` | `100` | Match limit per league per run |

> Note: `RIOT_API_KEY` is only used by the sync pipeline to call LoL Esports endpoints.
> The enrichment daemon uses Leaguepedia anonymously — no API key required.

> **ETL scripts** (`oracles_elixir_ingest.py`, `historical_backfill.py`) must be run with the project's
> `.venv` (Python 3.11, `elasticsearch==8.13.1`). The system-wide `elasticsearch` package may be v9
> and is incompatible with an ES 8.x server. Create the venv once:
> ```bash
> python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

---

## Troubleshooting

**`GET /health` returns 503**

Elasticsearch is still starting. Wait 30s and retry.

```bash
docker logs prostaff-scraper-elasticsearch-1 | tail -20
```

**`GET /api/v1/matches` returns empty**

Run a sync first:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sync?league=CBLOL&limit=20" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key"
```

**Enrichment stuck — all games at `enrichment_attempts: 3`**

Leaguepedia may not have data for these games yet (common for very recent matches).
They will be picked up automatically on the next daemon run after Leaguepedia updates.
To reset attempts and force retry:

```bash
# Reset attempts for all games (use with care)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9200/lol_pro_matches/_update_by_query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":{"range":{"enrichment_attempts":{"gte":3}}},"script":{"source":"ctx._source.enrichment_attempts=0"}}'
```

**Leaguepedia rate limit errors in logs**

Expected behavior during rapid testing. The enrichment daemon respects 9s between
requests. Errors automatically retry up to 3 times before incrementing `enrichment_attempts`.

**`401 Unauthorized` on sync/enrich endpoints**

Ensure `X-API-Key` header matches `SCRAPER_API_KEY` in your `.env`.

**Elasticsearch mapping conflict after upgrading from old schema**

The participant fields changed from integer IDs to string names. Delete and recreate:

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/lol_pro_matches
# Restart API and run sync — index is recreated automatically
```

---

## Integration with ProStaff API

The Rails API (`prostaff-api`) talks to this scraper in two ways:

**Live match sync** — `ProStaffScraperService` calls the scraper's REST API:
- `POST /api/v1/sync` — trigger a sync run
- `GET  /api/v1/enrich/status` — poll enrichment progress
- Used by `SyncScraperMatchesJob` and `HistoricalBackfillJob`

**Direct ES queries** — `ElasticsearchClient` queries the shared `lol_pro_matches` index directly:
- `GET /competitive/pro-matches/match-preview` — per-game picks + stats for a recent series
- `GET /competitive/pro-matches/es-series` — H2H history between two teams
- The data lake (97K+ games) is populated by all four pipelines above

**Setup:**
1. Set `SCRAPER_API_URL=https://scraper.prostaff.gg` in the Rails API environment
2. Set `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` to the same ES instance in both repos
3. See `PROSTAFF_SCRAPER_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md` for the full integration guide

**Running Oracle's Elixir ingest** (requires `.venv` — ES client v8):
```bash
cd /path/to/ProStaff-Scraper
ELASTICSEARCH_URL=https://user:pass@elastic.example.com \
  .venv/bin/python etl/oracles_elixir_ingest.py --years 2026

# Re-run is safe — duplicate gameids are skipped (op_type=create)
# To add a new year's CSV: download from oracleselixir.com and re-run with --years <year>
```
